I'm a first year masters student in [*Cornell Tech*](http://tech.cornell.edu/)'s Connective Media program, (which is not a media program!) Prior to that I studied physics at the City College of New York. イнナа spells my name in japanese and russian, my two halves. Please stay to check out my blog posts, projects and crafts.
