Lately I've been reviewing some machine learning and data science concepts, and needed a place to keep them all. In the past, whenever I would study something new, I wrote my notes in different places and would forget where I put them. So, I decided to start to writing down my notes in a [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) and open source them.

Thank you to [Baruch](http://blog.tabanpour.info/) for reviewing what I wrote and his additions/revisions! I just pushed the notebook to github and I'm hoping that other people will end up contributing as well or that someone finds it to be useful!
