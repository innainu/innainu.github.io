-- *translation: My Grandmother's Pillows* --

I went through some of [Marie Kondo's](http://tidyingup.com/) cleaning methods recently and decluttered a lot of my house. It felt.. amazing! Some might say I got a little carried away, because I threw out my bulky futon couch and replaced it with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A9SVX0S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) tatami mat. But, I don't miss my couch at all, and my apartment smells wonderful, just like my grandmother's tatami rooms.

I remember the pillows at my grandmother's house. They were full of something
like a bunch of small beans and they were kind of hard, nothing like the fluffy pillows in America. I looked it up, and found out that they were filled with [buckwheat hulls](http://buckwheathullpillows.com/what-are-buckwheat-hulls/). To complement the new addition to my apartment, I recently finished sewing 2 meditation pillows filled with these buckwheat hulls.
Making them was super easy, I kind of followed this [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-your-own-zafumeditation-pillow/), using a cast iron pan as a guide to make the circles for the seating part,

but made additional covers so I could wash them:

I'll forever miss my childhood summers at my grandmother's house but being able to bring a little of it back into my life everyday brings me a lot of joy!
