I recently graduated with an M.Sc in Information Science, specializing in Computer Science and in Connective Media (which isn't a media program!) at [*Cornell Tech*](http://tech.cornell.edu/). Prior to that I studied physics at the City College of New York. Please stay to check out my blog posts and projects.
