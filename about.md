I'm a software engineer, focused on Machine Learning, currently looking for new roles. I recently left Twitter after about 3.5 years spent in the Trust and Safety space. Prior to that I worked as a Backend SWE and Data Scientist. I'm a [*Cornell Tech*](http://tech.cornell.edu/) alumn, with an M.Sc in Information Science, specializing in Computer Science and in Connective Media.
